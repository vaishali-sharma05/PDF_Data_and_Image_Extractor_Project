# PDF_Data_and_Image_Extractor_Project

This project extracts tables and images from PDF documents using Python. It leverages the pdfplumber library to extract tables and save them in an Excel file, while fitz (from PyMuPDF) is used to extract images from the PDF and convert each page into PNG format. The project demonstrates how to automate PDF data extraction and image processing efficiently.
